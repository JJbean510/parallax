            <h2 class = "pblock">Castro Valley</h2>
            <p>What I love about Castro Valley is the small town environment. Even though you're located in one of the largest metropolitan areas in the country,the ambiance of the city screams <strong>SMALL TOWN!</strong> Downtown is composed of a few walkable blocks filled to the brim with mom & pop shops.
            One of my favorite Little Luca's Deli stays stocked with classic selections such as turkish delight, Big Deal dill pickles, Jones cane sugar soda and various other assortments. Castro Valley will always remain important for me for being the place I discovered my love of mathematics, 
            learned that deer can be neighbors and small dogs can pack a big bite.This is also where I first moved to when I decided to live with my aunt and uncle. I was spoiled to say the least, but I did learn a lot about myself and gained an interest in computers there.</p>

            <h2>San Leandro</h2>
            <p>Tucked away between Alameda and Hayward is San Leandro, a sleepy little suburb that hosts one of my favorite chill spots, the Marina. Its nothing special, just a lot on the shoreline, but what I love most about it is
                that Oakland Airport as well as the San Francisco skyline can both be seen from it. I like going here to think, like really think about life, where I'm going why and how to get there. I often visit the Marina when I'm
                feeling overwhelmed with emotions and thoughts and need some time to be alone. However, in recent months its become more of a happy place to reflect on friendship and bask in the glow of life. Moreover, this quaint little
                city boasts two of my favorite dining spots in all of the Bay; Bara's Deli and the Kendejah Restaurant. The former boasts some of the biggest sub sandwiches I've ever had and latter is the best place for West African food
                in all of the East Bay!

            <h2>Santa Cruz</h2>
            <p>Beyond a few mountains ranges to the south lie Santa Cruz. A city known a world away as the ideal destination for anyone seeking an escape from the daily hustle and bustle of the big city. The city boasts various smoke shops, hookah lounges, alternative spirituality, eastern meditation
                and a slew of other odds and ends shops for the hippie of any walk of life. In my teenage years my friends and I spent endless amounts of time here trailing through the woods, beaches, shops and college campuses. It all seems like so long ago, but the memories still remain.
                Santa Cruz will always hold a special place in my heart. Maybe because its the first place I did acid, maybe because I experienced the Earth's rotation here first hand, or maybe its because of the long summer nights putting down some beers and blowing back
                bowls. Whatever it is, it is magical and offers a welcoming hand to all that seek its consul.</p>
